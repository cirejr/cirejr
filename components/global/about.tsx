        I am a passionate and innovative front-end developer based in Mali,
        specializing in creating stunning user interfaces and seamless user
        experiences. With a strong foundation in Next.js and TypeScript, I
        thrive on solving complex problems and transforming ideas into reality.
        My journey in web development has been enriched by my work on an online
        learning platform and an enterprise-level management application, where
        I tackled diverse challenges like authentication flows, course
        management, and intricate data handling. I'm constantly exploring new
        technologies and am currently delving into finance tracking app
        development. As I step into the role of a sales agent, I'm eager to
        connect with clients and bring their visions to life through my
        technical expertise and creative solutions.
